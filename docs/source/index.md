# pamflow: Simplified analysis for passive acoustic monitoring

## What is *pamflow*?
**pamflow** integrates signal processing and machine listening tools into a cohesive data science framework. It ensures data adheres to FAIR principles by using established data standards, which lowers project barriers and boosts the interoperability of biodiversity records.

## Why *pamflow*?

Despite the widespread use of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM), a lack of integrated software and standardized data practices has hindered the effective analysis and management of valuable acoustic data. **pamflow** unifies fragmented software tools and standardize data formats, unlocking the full potential of PAM for research and conservation.
