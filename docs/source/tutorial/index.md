# Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the **pamflow**'s tutorial! This guide will walk you through the steps to step for  running **pamflow** and understanding its outputs.

For this, we will use an immersive example with real acoustic data. As soon as you understand this toy example, you will be able to run t**pamflow** with your own data.

***Context: The Guaviare Project***
*The National biodiversity institute in Colombia, the Humboldt Institute, collaborated with communities at Guaviare, Colombia to perform a communitary project on the local bird fauna. You are part of the project  and your task is to process the passively collected acoustic data, extract insights and produce relevant metrics and graphics for a report on the project. You will use **pamflow** to help you.*

***Your tasks***: 
1. Get familiar with the collected data.
2. Extract metadata from each audio file and each passive acoustic sensor.
3. Check that all sensors behaved as expected.
4. Report for presence of target species in the audios.
5. Select and store audio segments with target species' vocalizations.


On each of the followig sections you will find relevant information on how to use **pamflow** to complete all of your tasks. Next session is devoted to properly install  **pamflow** on your computer. If you are an experienced python user and want a faster, less detailed set-up you can find it here [here](../contributing_guidelines.md#getting-started).
